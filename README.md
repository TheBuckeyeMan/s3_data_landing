Data landing from Springboottutorial
the data located in springboottutorialapi is working and avaliable for you to mess around with. In order to properly land the data and logg it, we need you to run the api offering the data locally found here. https://github.com/spring-guides/quoters    -> clone the repo in a seporate window, compile a build and run that locally -> ensure that you properly configure the port in that quoters application to port 8089 or the code will not work when you run the java -jar command
